 * The CalLite GUI provides model users with a flexible user interface to edit and manage inputs
 * defining CalLite studies, and to calculate and display study results. The GUI is implemented 
 * to allow model developers to edit the GUI content, layout and many behaviors without recompiling
 * the underlying Java code.
