All of the *.wresl and *.table files that were created/modified for the power modeling are included in the main directory called "Ptemp".  To use the power files in a CALSIM study, follow the steps below.

1.  Rename the Ptemp directory to the name of the CALSIM study you wish to run.
2.  Copy the directory (previously called Ptemp) to the directory that includes your CALSIM study.
3.  Windows will prompt you with the following message:  "This folder already contains a folder named [study name]. . ."
4.  Click on the option, "Yes To All".

The power files will then be included in the study.  All other procedures necessary to run CALSIM are the same procedures necessary to run any CALSIM study.
