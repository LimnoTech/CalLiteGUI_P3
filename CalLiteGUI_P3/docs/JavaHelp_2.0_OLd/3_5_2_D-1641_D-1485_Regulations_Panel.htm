<h3>3.5.2. D-1641/D-1485 Regulations Panel</h3>
<p class="hcp1">This panel contains regulations described 
 by State Water Resources Control Board Decisions 1641 (D-1641) and 1485 
 (D-1485). These regulations are summarized below and in more detail in 
 Appendix C of the CalLite Reference Manual. Clicking the checkbox next 
 to a regulation will activate it. </p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2"><img src="image9.gif" alt="" border="0" height="24" width="25" class="hcp3" /> &#160;<span class="hcp4"><font color="red" ><b>WARNING:</b></font></span> D-1485 regulations are no longer 
 operationally used in California. The option to run a scenario with D-1485 
 regulations is provided simply as a service to users. </p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1">For many of these standards, the specific 
 D-1641 or D-1485 standard may be replaced with a user-defined standard. 
 If this is desired, after turning on the regulation, click on the radio 
 button for user-defined and enter desired values in the editable table 
 (on the right half of the screen). The numbered months refer to water 
 year months, so Oct = 1, Nov =2, etc.</p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1">The regulations on this panel are as follows:</p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp5">Interior 
 Delta Flows:</p>
<p class="hcp2"><span class="hcp6"><b>Delta Cross 
 Channel (DCC) -</b></span> This defines the numbers of days the DCC gates 
 are open in each month. Operation of the DCC assists in transferring fresh 
 water from the Sacramento River south across the Delta. Operations depend 
 on water quality, flood protection, and fish and wildlife requirements. 
 The number of days open each month can be adjusted using the user-defined 
 option.</p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp7">&#160;<img src="image10.gif" alt="" border="0" height="24" width="25" class="hcp3" /> &#160;<span class="hcp4"><font color="red" ><b>WARNING:</b></font></span> When the user-defined radio button 
 is selected, the Delta Cross Channel RPA (on the Biological Opinion RPAs 
 panel) should be disabled. </p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp5">River 
 Flows:</p>
<p class="hcp2"><span class="hcp6"><b>Sacramento 
 River at Rio Vista Minimum Flow -</b></span> This defines the minimum flow 
 requirement at Rio Vista, which vary by month and water year type. This 
 standard can be adjusted using the user-defined option.</p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2"><span class="hcp6"><b>Trinity 
 Minimum Flows -</b></span> This defines the Trinity River minimum flow that 
 was in place during the implementation of either the D-1485 or D-1641 
 standards. Note that these minimum flows are not considered part of the 
 D-1485 or D-1641 regulation and are not defined in either of the regulatory 
 documents. </p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">The default for a D-1485 regulatory environment 
 is lower minimum flows from the 340 TAF/yr Trinity minimum required flow 
 based on the Trinity River Index. The default for a D-1641 regulatory 
 environment is higher minimum flows from the 369-815 TAF/yr Trinity minimum 
 required flow based on the Trinity River Index.</p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">Users are not able to turn off the Trinity 
 minimum flows altogether, so to access the available options (D-1641 or 
 D-1485) for this checkbox, right click on the text for <span class="hcp8"><i>Trinity 
 Minimum Flows</i></span>. &#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp5">Delta 
 Outflows:</p>
<p class="hcp2"><span class="hcp6"><b>Minimum 
 Net Delta Outflow -</b></span> This defines the minimum outflow requirement 
 through the Delta. The flow standard varies depending on month, water 
 year type, and other criteria as specified in D-1641. </p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2"><span class="hcp6"><b>X2 Requirements 
 -</b></span> The X2 position is the distance (in kilometers) east of the Golden 
 Gate Bridge where the salinity level is two ppt (parts per thousand) Chloride. 
 The goal of this standard is to maintain the X2 position at or to the 
 west of certain specified locations. Under D-1641, this standard is in 
 place Feb-June and is enforced in different locations (Roe Island, Chipps 
 Island, and Collinsville) for different parts of each month depending 
 on certain criteria. </p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">When the user-defined radio button is selected, 
 the X2 standard can be turned on or off for each month, values can be 
 set in kilometers by month and water year type, and both the Roe Trigger 
 and the BO RPA Fall X2 standard should be disabled. </p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp7">&#160;&#160;&#160;<img src="image11.gif" alt="" border="0" height="24" width="24" class="hcp3" /> &#160;<span class="hcp4"><font color="red" ><b>WARNING:</b></font></span> When the 
 user-defined radio button is selected, both the Roe Trigger and the BO 
 RPA Fall X2 standard should be disabled. </p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2"><span class="hcp6"><b>Roe Trigger-</b></span> 
 This trigger is a D-1641 regulation. Under D-1641 standards, X2 is required 
 to be at or west of Roe Island for a certain number of days if the preceding 
 month's X2 position was west of Roe. If the preceding month's X2 position 
 was east of Roe, then the required number of days is automatically set 
 to zero. If the trigger is not activated (checked on), the required number 
 days west of Roe is always zero.</p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp7">&#160;&#160;<img src="image11.gif" alt="" border="0" height="24" width="24" class="hcp3" /> &#160;<span class="hcp4"><font color="red" ><b>WARNING:</b></font></span> Deactivate 
 if user-defined radio button option is selected for X2 regulation (on 
 the D-1641/D-1485 panel).</p>
<p class="hcp7">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp5">Export 
 Restrictions:</p>
<p class="hcp2"><span class="hcp6"><b>Export-Inflow 
 Ratio –</b></span> This D-1641 standard limits the combined exports of CVP 
 and SWP to a specific proportion of total Delta outflow. The standard 
 varies by month and river flow levels. When the user-defined option is 
 selected, this proportion (ratio) can be adjusted by month.</p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2"><span class="hcp6"><b>Vernalis 
 (Vernalis D-1641 Criteria) –</b></span> This standard limits the combined 
 exports of CVP and SWP to the minimum of two different standards during 
 the Apr 15-May 15 pulse period. The first standard is from D-1641, where 
 exports are limited to the maximum of 1,500 cfs or San Joaquin River flow 
 at Vernalis. The second standard is the VAMP (Vernalis Adaptive Management 
 Plan) export cap, which varies depending on the VAMP pulse flows released 
 during this same period. &#160;In certain situations it is possible for 
 the user to have the VAMP export cap turned on while the VAMP pulse flows 
 are turned off (either when using the dynamic San Joaquin module or when 
 using a D-1485 run basis, which has no VAMP pulse flows). &#160;In these 
 cases the VAMP export cap will be de-activated, since that cap is based 
 on the pulse flow requirement, so cannot be accurately set without it. 
 &#160;In these cases the D-1641 export cap will remain active.</p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2"><span class="hcp6"><b>Pumping 
 Limits (Jones and Banks) –</b></span> This limits pumping at Jones and Banks 
 pumping plants according to the selected regulation. Under D-1641, Jones 
 is limited to 4,600 and Banks is limited to 6,680. Under D-1485, Jones 
 and Banks are additionally limited to 3,000 CFS in May and June and Banks 
 is additionally limited to 4,600 in July. Users are not able to turn off 
 the pumping limits altogether, so to access the available options (D-1641 
 or D-1485) for this checkbox, right click on the text for <span class="hcp8"><i>Pumping 
 Limits (Jones and Banks)</i></span>. &#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp5">Salinity 
 Standards:</p>
<p class="hcp2">CalLite includes the option to include salinity 
 standards at: Emmaton and Jersey Point (for agriculture), Rock Slough 
 (for Municipal and Industrial), and Collinsville (for fish and wildlife), 
 and Antioch and Chipps (D-1485 additional standard locations). These standards 
 vary depending on month and water year type. </p>
