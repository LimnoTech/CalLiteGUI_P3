<h2>4.3. Map View</h2>
<p>The Map View Dashboard allows users to view the CalLite study results 
 by clicking on the arcs, nodes, and reservoirs in the CalLite schematic. 
 Users can choose to view results from the standard schematic or from the 
 mass balance schematic. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><i><b>Note:</b></i></span> <span 
	 style="font-style: italic;"><i>Data for the San Joaquin schematic will 
 not be available unless the selected scenario was run with Dynamic SJR 
 simulation turned on.</i></span> </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The mass balance schematic aggregates schematic arcs into larger categories. 
 These categories, represented by the red arrows, account for the major 
 inflows, outflows, exports and net consumption within the Delta. Alongside 
 the major flows are selectable elements for salinity stations (represented 
 by yellow circles) and flow objectives (represented by blue circles). 
 Clicking on the Salinity Station will display the salinity at that station 
 along with its respective salinity standard. Similarly, selecting the 
 blue circles will display the flow at that location with its respective 
 flow objective.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Controls</p>
<p>To zoom in, hold the ctrl key and draw a box over the area to be enlarged. 
 An alternative way to zoom in and out is to hold down shift key and right 
 click simultaneously and then move the mouse up and down. To pan across 
 the schematic, hold down the shift key and click/drag anywhere in the 
 window. Click on ‘Controls’ at any time to load a CalLite study, or change 
 the format of the data output. </p>
