<h2>4.1. Quick Results</h2>
<p>Under the Quick Results dashboard, graphs and tables can be generated 
 for numerous CalLite outputs, either for one scenario or for comparing 
 multiple scenarios. The different sections on this dashboard are as follows:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span class="hcp1"><b>Scenarios.</b></span> Here the user can 
 add or delete scenarios to determine which scenario results will be displayed. 
 The number of scenarios and type of results to display (either for a single 
 base scenario, a comparison of scenarios, or the difference between scenarios) 
 can also be selected. The radio button next to each scenario name can 
 be used to select which scenario to delete. For difference plots, the 
 radio button sets which scenario to use as the basis for comparison when 
 computing difference values.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span class="hcp1"><b>Display.</b></span> Options for displaying 
 results:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">-Start and end month and year.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">-Flow data in either CFS or TAFY (i.e. TAF 
 per year). Variables other than flow have fixed units (TAF for storage, 
 μmhos/cm for salinity). Note: μmhos is a unit of specific conductivity.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">-Monthly time-series plot.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">-Exceedance plots and Box and Whiskers plots. 
 These plots can be shown for individual months, all monthly values, or 
 annual totals. The annual total exceedance plots are only shown for flow 
 variables and the units are always TAF.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">-Table of monthly values. For flow variables, 
 the annual total shown is always in TAF.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">-Summary table. The summary table can show 
 five different statistics (average, maximum, minimum, standard deviation, 
 and median) computed from monthly and annual values, summarized by four 
 different water year types, and for the three driest periods in 1922-2003. 
 When summarizing data by water year type, the Sacramento Valley 40-30-30 
 Index, Feather Index, and SJR (San Joaquin Valley 60-20-20) Index use 
 February as the first month of the water year; the Shasta Index uses March.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span class="hcp1"><b>Report List.</b></span> This section of 
 the dashboard can be used to create reports based on user selections. 
 Clicking the <span class="hcp3"><i>Add To List</i></span> button, 
 following the selection of a variable(s), will add the variable(s) to 
 the list. The report will then include all variables that have been selected. 
 In addition, the report will reflect the user options within the Scenario 
 and Display areas of the dashboard. Reports on the list can then be displayed 
 (individually or all at once) and saved for later use. Lists can also 
 be saved and reloaded using the <span class="hcp3"><i>Save 
 List</i></span> and Load List buttons, respectively.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span class="hcp1"><b>Output selection.</b></span> &#160;Double-clicking 
 any of the variable names in the Report List section will display graphs 
 and tables for that specific variable. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul class="hcp4">
	<ul class="hcp4">
		<li><p class="hcp5"><span class="hcp3"><i>Storage+Flows</i></span> 
		 – standard output variables for flow, storage, and salinity</p></li>
		<li><p class="hcp5"><span class="hcp3"><i>San 
		 Joaquin R.</i></span> – San Joaquin River terms for storage, flow, 
		 deliveries, and salinity</p></li>
		<li><p class="hcp5"><span class="hcp3"><i>Shortages/Flow 
		 Obj.</i></span> – shortages in accretion/depletion (AD) terms for 
		 the North of Delta area, and comparisons of Delta outflow and 
		 Sacramento/San Joaquin River flows to the State Water Resources 
		 Control Board (SWRCB) Delta Flow Criteria</p></li>
		<li><p class="hcp5"><span class="hcp3"><i>Water 
		 Mgt. Actions</i></span> – Los Vaqueros terms</p></li>
		<li><p class="hcp5"><span class="hcp3"><i>Delivery 
		 Shortages</i></span> – SWP and CVP South of Delta delivery shortage 
		 terms</p></li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>When graphs are displayed it is possible to zoom in by clicking and 
 dragging the cursor to the lower right to create a box. Once zoomed in, 
 the user can pan by holding down the left button and the Control key, 
 and then moving the mouse. Right clicking in the graph area will bring 
 up a menu that allows the user to edit properties of the graph; copy, 
 save, and print the graph; zoom in, zoom out, and reset the plot to its 
 original zoom; and copy the data used to create the graph into the clipboard 
 for use in another application. In addition to the primary time-series, 
 certain graphs also display secondary time-series (described in the legend).</p>
