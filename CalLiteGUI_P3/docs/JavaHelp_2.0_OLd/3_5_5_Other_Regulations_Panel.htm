<h3>3.5.5 Other Regulations Panel</h3>
<p>This panel allows the user to activate three additional regulations 
 and define values for them in the table on the right side of the screen. 
 The month numbers in the user-defined tables refer to water year months 
 (i.e. Oct=1, Nov=2, etc.)</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The regulations available on the Other Regulations Panel are:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>QWEST (San 
 Joaquin River near Jersey Point).</b></span> This is a minimum flow standard 
 on the San Joaquin River near Jersey Point. The user can define values 
 for this standard by month and water year type.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>Old and 
 Middle River.</b></span> This limits CVP and SWP exports so that flow in the 
 Old and Middle River (OMR) is no more negative than a specified standard 
 during Dec-June. Standards can be specified by month and water year type. 
 </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="image14.gif" alt="" border="0" height="24" width="25" class="hcp4" /><span class="hcp5"><font color="red" ><b> 
 WARNING:</b></font></span> When the user-defined radio button is selected, the RPA 
 OMR (on the Biological Opinion RPAs panel) standard should be disabled. 
 </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>San Joaquin 
 River Inflow to Export ratio with offset.</b></span> This limits combined 
 CVP and SWP exports to a cap computed based on San Joaquin River flow 
 at Vernalis. The cap is computed as: offset+(multiplier×Vernalis). The 
 offset and multiplier values can be specified by month and water year 
 type. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="image14.gif" alt="" border="0" height="24" width="25" class="hcp4" /> <span class="hcp5"><font color="red" ><b>WARNING:</b></font></span> 
 When the user-defined radio button is selected, the RPA SJR Inflow to 
 Export Ratio (on the Biological Opinion RPAs panel) standard should be 
 disabled. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>B2 Actions.</b></span> 
 These buttons implement actions from the Central Valley Project Improvement 
 Act (CVPIA) Section 3406(b)(2) program (referred to as “B2”) to dedicate 
 up to 800,000 acre-feet of CVP yield annually for fish and wildlife protection 
 and habitat restoration. From the initial implementation of the B2 program, 
 up to seven actions were modeled by CalLite. Recently introduced regulations 
 have made Actions 2, 6 and 7 redundant. Consequently, these actions are 
 no longer modeled and are not available as GUI selections. The available 
 actions are:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp6">Action 1: &#160;Upstream 
 Minimum Flow Requirements</p>
<p class="hcp6">Action 3: &#160;VAMP 
 Export Reduction (April 15 – May15)</p>
<p class="hcp6">Action 4: &#160;CVP 
 VAMP Export Extension (May 16 – 31)</p>
<p class="hcp6">Action 5: &#160;CVP 
 Export Ramping (June 1 – 30)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 4.5pt;">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>Fraction 
 of Unimpaired Flow for Delta Criteria.</b></span> In July 2010, the State 
 Water Resources Control Board issued a report on Delta flow criteria. 
 The user can activate those criteria in the model (for Delta outflow, 
 the Sacramento River, and the San Joaquin River) and also specify different 
 criteria if desired. Note that unlike all of the other regulations on 
 this dashboard, when this option is activated, this is a post-processing 
 option, NOT a regulation. CalLite does not force flows at these locations 
 to meet these criteria. It only compares flows to the criteria and computes 
 how much additional water would be needed to meet the criteria.</p>
