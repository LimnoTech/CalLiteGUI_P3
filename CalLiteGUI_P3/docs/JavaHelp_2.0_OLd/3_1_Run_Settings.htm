<h2>3.1. Run Settings</h2>
<p>The Run Settings dashboard allows the user to load, save, run, select 
 scenario(s), view scenario settings, enter a scenario description, initiate 
 batch runs, specify the run period, run type, and specify the run basis.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Scenario settings are saved with a file extension .cls (CalLite Scenario). 
 The file is portable and can be easily loaded by another user.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The <span class="hcp1"><b>View Scenario Settings</b></span> button 
 allows the user to view all selected scenario options in a summarized 
 table. This should be checked to ensure that all settings are correct 
 before running.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Run Period can be set to any period starting no earlier than Oct 
 1921 and ending no later than Sep 2003 (water years 1922-2003). In this 
 version of CalLite, only deterministic run types are possible. Probabilistic 
 runs may be added in later versions of the model. The Run Basis sets the 
 type of CalSim II run to use as a baseline of the CalLite run. Currently, 
 three run bases are available: Biological Opinion RPAs, Pre-Biological 
 Opinion RPAs, and D-1485. The base CalSim II run affects the AD (accretion/depletion) 
 terms that are used in CalLite (through the SV input file) and also the 
 WSI-DI tables. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If shortages associated with AD terms in the North of Delta area exist, 
 CalLite will display a warning message at the end of the simulation. See 
 Appendix A of the CalLite Reference Manual for a further description of 
 AD terms and shortages.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The <span class="hcp1"><b>Batch Runs</b></span> option provides 
 the capability to run up to four CalLite studies simultaneously, which 
 is more efficient than having to parameterize and run each individual 
 study through a separate GUI instance.</p>
