<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The CalLite 3.00 User's Guide facilitates easy use of the CalLite GUI 
 by describing all of the screens, dashboards, panels, and options available 
 on the GUI. For information on aspects of the model other than the graphical 
 user interface (GUI), see the CalLite 3.00 Reference Manual, which is 
 distributed as a separate PDF.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>1.1. &#160;The CalLite 3.00 Model&#160;&#160;</h2>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>CalLite is an interactive screening model for management of California’s 
 water systems. It simulates the hydrology of the Central Valley, reservoir 
 operations and delivery allocation decisions for the State Water Project 
 (SWP) and Central Valley Project (CVP), delta salinity responses to river 
 flow and export changes, and habitat-ecosystem indices. CalLite contains 
 much of the same functionality as the more detailed CalSim II model, but 
 is simplified in its spatial and hydrologic detail. The power of a screening 
 model such as CalLite is the ability to rapidly simulate system operations 
 and to incorporate changes with relative ease. The current version of 
 CalLite simulates system operations on a monthly basis for the full 82-year 
 period of record (water year 1922-2003) in approximately 5 minutes (in 
 comparison to 30 minutes in CalSim) on an up-to-date modeling computer, 
 and can be run with a variety of different options in terms of hydroclimate, 
 demands, facilities and infrastructure, regulations, and system operations. 
 Despite the simplifications included in CalLite, the model results corroborate 
 with a comparable CalSim II study.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>CalLite 3.00, the newest version of the CalLite model, is implemented 
 using an updated simulation engine developed from the Water Resource Integrated 
 Modeling System 2 (WRIMS 2). Moving to a WRIMS 2 engine allowed the easy 
 implementation of new CalLite features in an efficient way and maintains 
 CalLite’s corroboration with CalSim (now also run in WRIMS 2). </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Further information on the CalLite 3.00 model can be found in this User's 
 Guide, in the CalLite 3.00 Reference Manual, and at the <a href="http://baydeltaoffice.water.ca.gov/modeling/hydrology/CalLite/index.cfm">CalLite&#160;website</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A CalLite tutorial is available at the end of this User's Guide.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>1.2. &#160;Installation</h2>
<p>The CalLite model is currently delivered in a single installer file. 
 Installation consists of extracting all files in the archive (.zip) to 
 a file system location on a Windows XP, Vista, or Windows 7 computer. 
 During installation, a CalLite3.00.exe icon is generated on the desktop. 
 The software is started by double-clicking the icon. Alternatively, users 
 may start the CalLite GUI from start&gt;program&gt;CalLite3.00&gt;CalLite3.00. 
 Users may also start the CalLite GUI by double-clicking on the file “CalLiteGUI.exe” 
 in the root directory of the extracted version (see Figure 1-1 below).</p>
