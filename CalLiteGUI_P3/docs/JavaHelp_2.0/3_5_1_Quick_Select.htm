<h3>3.5.1. Quick Select </h3>
<p>The Quick Select box at the top of the dashboard gives users the option 
 to select a “standard” run for one of the following regulatory environments: 
 D-1485, D-1641, and D-1641 plus BO RPAs. Choosing one of these Quick Select 
 options with automatically enable all the default regulations for that 
 regulatory environment.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If a user would like to deviate from one of the standard regulatory 
 environments, the User Defined Quick Select option must be selected. The 
 GUI will store the set of options enabled prior to the selection of User 
 Defined Quick Select. For example, if a user selects D-1641 Quick Select 
 and then chooses User Defined Quick Select, the editable options will 
 represent D-1641 regulations (i.e. X2, Roe Trigger, Export-Inflow, and 
 Vernalis will be checked ON, while Salinity Standards at Antioch and Chipps 
 will be checked OFF).</p>

 when setting user-defined standards. This feature is for advanced model 
 users, since user-specified values may cause non-feasible operations, 
 even if the model appears to complete successfully. Please check with 
 modeling/operations experts to ensure that criteria for these inputs and 
 resulting outputs remain reasonable.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Appendix C of the CalLite Reference Manual has a detailed description 
 of all of the regulations on this dashboard.</p>
