<h3>3.5.3. Biological Opinion RPAs Panel</h3>
<p>The standards listed on this panel implement Reasonable and Prudent 
 Alternatives (RPAs) as described in the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) 
 and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) biological opinions released 
 in December 2008 and June 2009, respectively. See Appendix C in the CalLite 
 Reference Manual for more detailed descriptions of these RPAs. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The RPAs on this panel are:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>Old and 
 Middle River (FWS RPA Actions 1-3) -</b></span> This limits CVP and SWP exports 
 so that flow in the Old and Middle River is no more negative than a specified 
 standard during Dec-June. Depending on the time of year, along with the 
 hydrologic and biological conditions, this standard can vary from -1,250 
 to -5,000 cfs.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="image12.gif" alt="" border="0" height="24" width="25" class="hcp4" /><span class="hcp5"><font color="red" ><b> 
 &#160;WARNING:</b></font></span> Deactivate if Old and Middle River regulation is 
 selected on the Others panel and the corresponding user-defined radio 
 button option is selected on that panel. </p>
<p class="hcp3">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>Fall X2 
 (FWS RPA Action 4) -</b></span> This sets X2 standards for Sept-Nov, which 
 are applied in wet and above normal water years. Since this RPA is active 
 in different months than the D-1641 X2 standard, both can be applied in 
 the same scenario. </p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp3"><img src="image12.gif" alt="" border="0" height="24" width="25" class="hcp4" /> <span class="hcp5"><font color="red" ><b>WARNING:</b></font></span> 
 Deactivate if D-14641 X2 regulation is selected on the D-1641/D-1485 panel 
 and the corresponding user-defined radio button option is selected on 
 that panel.</p>
<p class="hcp3">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>Clear Creek 
 (NMFS RPA Action 1.1.1) -</b></span> This sets minimum flow standards in Clear 
 Creek.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1">Delta Cross Channel (NMFS RPA Action 4.1.2) 
 - This defines the number of days the DCC gates are open in each month. 
 DCC operations under this RPA are set so that the gates are never open 
 for longer than required under the D-1641 DCC standard, and in some months 
 the RPA may result in even fewer days open. Since this RPA was crafted 
 as extra protection above and beyond the D-1641 standard, it will operate 
 independently of the D-1641 DCC standard.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp3"><span class="hcp5"><font color="red" ><b><img src="image13.gif" alt="" border="0" height="24" width="25" class="hcp4" /> &#160;WARNING:</b></font></span> 
 Deactivate if D-14641 Delta Cross Channel regulation is selected on the 
 D-1641/D-1485 panel and the corresponding user-defined radio button option 
 is selected on that panel.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>San Joaquin 
 River Inflow to Export Ratio (NMFS RPA Action 4.2.1) -</b></span> This limits 
 combined exports from the CVP and SWP to a fraction of the flow observed 
 along the San Joaquin River at Vernalis.</p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
