<h3>3.5.4. SJR Controls Panel</h3>
<p>The controls on this tab relate to operation of the dynamic San Joaquin 
 module of CalLite. &#160;Checking the top checkbox will activate this 
 module. &#160;If this checkbox is not checked, the flows on the San Joaquin 
 at Vernalis (where it enters the Delta) will be represented as a fixed 
 timeseries, and the other checkboxes will have no effect. &#160;The dynamic 
 San Joaquin module allows for adjustment of certain regulations that apply 
 to the San Joaquin basin, in particular to New Melones Reservoir on the 
 Stanislaus River. &#160;Activating the appropriate checkbox will activate 
 each of the regulations.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Note that regulations in the San Joaquin basin are currently under review. 
 &#160;The two pulse period regulations listed below (VAMP and the 60-day 
 pulse flow RPA) are not implemented in current operations in the San Joaquin 
 basin, but are options in the model because new pulse period flow requirements 
 have not been clearly defined. &#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The regulations on this tab are as follows:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>Vernalis 
 D-1641 baseflows-</b></span> This activates the D-1641 flow requirements at 
 Vernalis during February to June (excluding the April 15 - May 15 pulse 
 period). &#160;These requirements vary by water year type and whether 
 X2 is located east or west of Chipps. &#160;Any additional water needed 
 to meet these requirements above the flows required for other regulations 
 is released from New Melones Reservoir, with a cap on releases in dry 
 conditions.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>Vernalis 
 D-1641 salinity criteria-</b></span> This activates the D-1641 salinity requirements 
 at Vernalis, which are 0.7 Electrical Conductivity (EC) during April-August 
 and 1.0 EC during September-March. &#160;Any additional water needed to 
 meet these requirements above the flows required for other regulations 
 is released from New Melones Reservoir, with a cap on releases in extremely 
 dry conditions.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>VAMP pulse 
 flows (Apr 15-May 15)-</b></span> This activates flow requirements at Vernalis 
 during the April 15 - May 15 pulse period. &#160;These flow requirements 
 vary depending on whether the model is run with Existing or Future Level 
 of Development. &#160;For Future Level of Development, the flow requirements 
 are based on the Vernalis Adaptive Management Program (VAMP) that was 
 implemented from 1999-2011. &#160;Water is released to meet these requirements 
 from multiple tributaries on a schedule defined in the San Joaquin River 
 Agreement. &#160;For Existing Level of Development the flow requirements 
 are based on the agreement between Reclamation and Merced Irrigation District 
 which was implemented in 2012-2013. &#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>Vernalis 
 60-day pulse flow RPA (NMFS Action 4.2.1)-</b></span> This activates a 60-day 
 pulse flow requirement at Vernalis during April and May, which varies 
 by water year type. &#160;This requirement is in the NMFS Biological Opinion 
 released in June 2009. &#160;Any additional water needed to meet this 
 requirement above the flows required for other regulations is released 
 from New Melones Reservoir, with a cap on releases in dry conditions.</p>
<p class="hcp1">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>Stanislaus 
 flow RPA (NMFS Action 3.1.3)-</b></span> This activates a fish flow requirement 
 on the Stanislaus River which varies by water year type. &#160;This requirement 
 is from the NMFS Biological Opinion released in June 2009. &#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp1"><span class="hcp2"><b>San Joaquin 
 River Restoration flows-</b></span> This toggles the San Joaquin River Restoration 
 flows between interim flows and full flows. &#160;Flow requirements vary 
 by water year type. &#160;These flows are released from Friant Dam on 
 the upper San Joaquin River, and are defined under the 2006 Settlement 
 that led to the San Joaquin River Restoration Program. &#160;Interim flows 
 are designed to allow for collection of data and research prior to implementation 
 of full Restoration flows.</p>
