<h2>3.6. Operations</h2>
<p>The operations dashboard has options relating to CVP and SWP system 
 operations, as follows:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span class="hcp1"><b>CVP Operations and Facilities.</b></span> 
 The checkboxes here can be used to turn on or off three different wheeling 
 operations: Payback Wheeling (D-1485), CVC Wheeling, and Joint Point of 
 Diversion. The option is also available to turn on or off the Delta- Mendota 
 Canal (DMC)/California Aqueduct Intertie. The Intertie project allows 
 the DMC and California Aqueduct to share conveyance capacity, thus increasing 
 export capacity. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For more detailed description of these operational facilities, see the 
 Reference Manual. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span class="hcp1"><b>CVP/SWP Allocation Methods.</b></span> 
 Here the user can choose between different CVP and SWP allocation methods. 
 Currently, users have the option for allocation by either Water Supply 
 Index/Delivery Index (WSI/DI) curves or by the Forecast Allocation Method 
 (FAM). </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">WSI-DI Method</p>
<p class="hcp3">The WSI-DI method is the procedure currently 
 used in CalSim II. This logic develops an allocation decision for system-wide 
 CVP and SWP deliveries based on water in storage, forecasts of usable 
 inflow, and storage carryover targets. The allocations for the CVP Water 
 Right, Exchange, and Settlement contractors and SWP Feather River Service 
 Area contractors are dependent on reservoir inflow criteria. South-of-Delta 
 delivery allocations for the CVP are based on water in CVP San Luis storage 
 plus projections of available water for export prior to low point. This 
 is identical to the current procedure used in CalSim II. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp3">Default WSI/DI curves for both CVP and SWP 
 may be altered by clicking on the appropriate box and editing the values 
 in the table on the right side of the screen. The user should be aware 
 that the WSI-DI curves should be edited with caution. They are carefully 
 developed through iterative simulation of CalSim II, with a particular 
 set of water supplies and demands. More aggressive allocations may result 
 in reservoir storage conditions that are not able to meet regulations 
 through dry years. Relaxed allocations may result in storage levels that 
 create higher flows in some months and unexpected modifications to Delta 
 operations. </p>

														 color: #ff0000;"><font color="red" ><b>WARNING:</b></font></span> 
 Model results may differ from expected operation, so a careful analysis 
 of the output results by an expert is always necessary. </p>
<p class="hcp3">&#160;</p>
<p class="hcp2">FAM Method</p>
<p class="hcp3">FAM is developed based on the California 
 Allocation Module (CAM). The model is developed by utilizing the multi-step 
 optimization functions in WRIMS 2. FAM is coupled with the CalLite model 
 by working as an additional cycle.</p>
<p class="hcp3">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">For more information about CalLite allocation 
 methods, see Appendix G of the CalLite Reference Manual.</p>
