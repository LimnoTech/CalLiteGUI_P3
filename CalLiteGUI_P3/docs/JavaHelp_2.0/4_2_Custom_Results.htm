<h2>4.2. Custom Results</h2>
<p>The Custom Results Dashboard allows the user to filter and retrieve 
 variables directly from the DV or SV file, including variables that cannot 
 be selected through Quick Results or Map View. The filtered variables 
 can be displayed in the same format as those brought up from Quick Results 
 (i.e. Exceedance Plots, tables). This feature combines the broad range 
 of post-processing features from Quick Results with the ability to bring 
 up and analyze any variable in the DSS files. The user can view the data 
 for these variables directly, or they may elect to create derived time-series 
 (DTS) from them. DTS are created by combining two or more time-series 
 with basic mathematical operators and may be custom-tailored to fit the 
 needs of a specific project or investigation. These DTS can be saved and 
 accessed at a later session.</p>
